# Welcome to the SourceHut GraphQL explorer!
# You can use this to run test requests against the GraphQL API.
# To view the GraphQL schema, expand the button on the bottom of this page.
# Here's a sample query to get you started:
query {
  # Fetch info about the authenticated user (you):
  me {
    # Grab their canonical name:
    canonicalName
    # And a list of build jobs:
    jobs {
      # This resource is paginated, so it has a cursor. If you pass this
      # value into sshKeys(cursor:"...") in a subsequent request, you'll
      # get the next page.
      cursor
      # These are the actual results.
      results {
        id
        image
        tasks {
          name
          status
          log { last128KiB }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  # Also fetch the API version. Please note that the GraphQL API is
  # considered experimental: as long as this returns 0.0.0, the API is
  # subject to change without notice.
  version {
    major, minor, patch
