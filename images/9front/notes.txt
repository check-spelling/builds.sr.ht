This starts with a fairly bog-standard 9front installation. glenda's password is
set to "password".

Our /lib/ndb/local setup looks like this:

	auth=build authdom=9front
	ipnet=9front ip-10.0.0.0 ipmask=255.255.255.0
		ipgw=10.0.2.2
		dns=8.8.8.8
		auth=build
		dnsdom=9front
		cpu=build
	sys=build ether=525400123456 ip=10.0.2.15 dom=build.9front

These settings match the expectations from qemu's user mode networking.

The installation is configured as a CPU server. /usr/glenda/lib/profile is
updated to start webfs for CPU logins.

A heavily patched drawterm implementation is used to remove the MASSIVE GAPING
HOLES in drawterm's security model:

https://hg.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/drawterm

Future work:
- Import builds.sr.ht secrets into factotum?
- Package support, whatever that might mean for 9front
- Script to generate updated qcow2's with
- Proxy SSH logins to drawterm for logging into failed builds
- Patch 9front's Mercurial to support cloning via hg.sr.ht's updated protocols
- Add golang? /shrug
